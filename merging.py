"""
The LSMSSegmentation application allows to filter out small segments.
In the output segmented image, those segments will be removed and replaced
by the background label (0). Another solution to deal with the small regions
is to merge them with the closest big enough adjacent region in terms of
radiometry. This is handled by the LSMSSmallRegionsMerging application,
which will output a segmented image where small regions have been merged.
Again, the uint32 image type is advised for this output image.

otbcli_LSMSSmallRegionsMerging -in filtered_range.tif
                               -inseg segementation.tif
                               -out segmentation_merged.tif uint32
                               -minsize 10
                               -tilesizex 256
                               -tilesizey 256

The minsize parameter allows to specify the threshold on the size of the
regions to be merged. Like the LSMSSegmentation application, this application
will process the input images tile-wise to keep resources usage low, with
the guarantee of identical results. You can set the tile size using the
tilesizex and tilesizey parameters. However unlike the LSMSSegmentation
application, it does not require to write any temporary file to disk.
