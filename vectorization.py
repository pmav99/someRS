"""
The last step of the LSMS workflow consists in the vectorization of the
segmented image into a GIS vector file. This vector file will contain one
polygon per segment, and each of these polygons will hold additional
attributes denoting the label of the original segment, the size of the
segment in pixels, and the mean and variance of each band over the segment.
The projection of the output GIS vector file will be the same as the
projection from the input image (if input image has no projection, so
does the output GIS file).

                         -tilesizey 256

This application will process the input images tile-wise to keep resources
usage low, with the guarantee of identical results. You can set the tile
size using the tilesizex and tilesizey parameters. However unlike the
LSMSSegmentation application, it does not require to write any temporary
file to disk.
